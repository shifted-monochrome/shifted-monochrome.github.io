                <h2>Character Selection</h2>
                <p>When a round starts, players will be shown the Character Selection screen. The screen is divided into two parts, with character selection on the right third and character viewing on the left third. At the top of the viewing area is the name of the currently selected map.</p>
                <p>The right side consists of 12 boxes split into 4 groups of 3 if the player has been assigned to be an Experiment, or 2 rows of 2 if they've been assigned to be an Eradicator. Clicking on a character that nobody else has selected will select that character. The selected character will have an outline around their box, while characters others have selected will have their boxes crossed out with the player's display name underneath them. At the bottom of the character selection is the currently selected Experiment's name.</p>
                <p>The left side has a segment of the map in the background, with Experiments standing in a row in the order of when they were selected. At the bottom of the viewing area is the currently selected Eradicator, their name, and the display name of the player who has been chosen to be the Eradicator.</p>

                <h2>Final 80</h2>
                <p>Once 80 seconds (1 minute and 20 seconds) are left on the round timer, the round enters "Final 80". The atmosphere becomes more intense, the exit (or exits) becomes active, and depending on the map unique changes may be applied.</p>
                <p>Please check the <a href="maps.html">individual map pages</a> for more information on changes during Final 80, as in-depth information regarding mechanics and visual changes differ from map to map.</p>

                <h2>Results Screen</h2>
                <p>Upon concluding a round, players will be shown the Results Screen. The screen displays information such as how many stuns the player had, their danger time (how many seconds they spent in a chase), how many rings were earned that round, any multipliers the player obtained, their total score, and their rank.</p>
                <p>The screen also displays brief information about other Experiments (consisting of their Experiment icon, display name, stuns, danger time, and final rank) as well as information about the Eradicators (consisting of their Eradicator icon, display name, kills, downs, overall damage, and final rank).</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Last Creature Standing</h2>
                <p>Upon reaching a point where all other Experiments have been killed, the final Experiment and the Eradicator enter "Last Creature Standing". The final Experiment will undergo a "Second Wind" and have 30 HP added to their maximum health, as well as being fully healed. The round timer will be set to the same length as the Experiment's Last Creature Standing theme regardless of how much time was left on it. Provided the exit hasn't yet spawned, it will spawn once 30 seconds are left on the round timer.</p>
                <p>During Last Creature Standing, certain Eradicators and Experiments will undergo changes. These changes can involve abilities, visuals, or both. These changes are documented in more detail on each character's page.</p>

                <h2>Parry</h2>
                <p>As the Eradicator, timing your attack so that it lands right before an Experiment's attack is going to hit you negates the Experiment's stun. If the attack is a projectile, the projectile is destroyed. If the attack is a melee attack, you and the Experiment are pushed an equal distance away from each other, with the distance being equal to the formula <code>0.5(x + y)</code> with <code>x</code> being your attack's knockback distance and <code>y</code> being the Experiment's attack's knockback distance.</p>

                <h2>Status Effects</h2>
                <p><b>Burn</b>: Burn, while inflicted, will slow down Experiments and Eradicators. It also does damage over time to Experiments.</p>
                <p><b>Frostbite</b>: Frostbite, while inflicted, has a chance to stun an Eradicator up to 3 times. In addition, Experiments and Eradicators inflicted with Frostbite will be slowed down slightly more than Burn does.</p>
                <p><b>Waterlogged</b>: When interacting with a waist-deep water source, or any water source deeper than that, Waterlogged will be inflicted. While inflicted with Waterlogged, movement will be slowed slightly. Waterlogged will automatically wear off upon exiting the water source, with the exception of Metal Dankles and Camilla who will retain the status for a few seconds before drying off.</p>
                <p><b>Infatuated</b>: Infatuated stops the player in place in a manner similar to a stun. The effect lasts for a few seconds before the Experiment or Eradicator recomposes themselves.</p>

                <div class="box-header"><p>Ratings</p></div>
                <p>Upon finishing a round, each player is given a rank and a score dependent on how many Void Fragments they obtained during the round, and is further influenced by modifiers reflecting the player's actions and the outcome, such as "Escaped" and "Betrayal". While the rank and score are directly correlated to the amount of Void Fragments gained, the modifiers do not impact how many you obtain at the end of the round.</p>

                <h2>Ray's Store</h2>
                <p>Ray's Store is the place where players can purchase <a href="cosmetics.html">cosmetics</a> for their Experiments and Eradicators, as well as where they can purchase emotes, all using Void Fragments. The shop itself an in-universe webpage themed around a mixture of the Frutiger Aero and Webcore aesthetics. The digital storefront is owned by the eponymous "Ray the 2009 Raccoon", and can be accessed through a laptop on a desk in the lobby.</p>
                <p>The right side of the store is made up of a browser, open to Ray's Store. The store itself has four labelled headers corresponding to the four owners, and opening them reveals each character. Clicking a character opens a popup with options for purchasing cosmetics, having tabs for each cosmetic type.</p>
                <p>In the top left is a window with Ray himself. He lazily watches the player as they browse his store, occasionally making comments in regards to the player's actions (or inactions). Underneath him is another window featuring a randomized character and a fun fact about them.</p>
                <p>Purchased cosmetics can be equipped through the inventory, appearing as <abbr title="This is because more than half of the cast is (allegedly) queer in some capacity.">a closet</abbr> next to the laptop. Due to the shop only providing cosmetics, as Experiments and Eradicators are all free, interacting with the shop at all is entirely optional.</p>

                <h2>The Closet</h2>
                <p>The Closet is where the player actually applies owned cosmetics and emotes to their Experiments and Eradicators. From the outside, it appears as an inconspicuous closet, however entering the closet reveals it to be much bigger and more house-like on the inside. In the center of the screen is the character currently being edited. The character can be rotated, moved, and zoomed in on to get a closer look at how cosmetics sit on them.</p>
                <p>On the left side is the cosmetics the player has purchased for that character, filtered by cosmetic type, and on the right is the emote selector. The emote selector is split into three sections, with the top being character-exclusive emotes, the middle being global emotes, and the bottom showing the player how their emote selector will look in game. Next to the cosmetic selector is a toggle to view a character's LCS form, should they have one. If they don't have an LCS form the option will be unavailable.</p>
                <p>At the bottom of the screen is the character selector. It has four tabs at the top of it, each corresponding to the four owners, and upon selecting one the four character icons will change to represent that owner's Experiments and Eradicator. Arrows on either side can be used to switch which tab is selected.</p>
