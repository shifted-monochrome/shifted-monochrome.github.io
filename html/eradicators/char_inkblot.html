            <h2 style="font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif;color:whitesmoke;font-size:30px;font-weight:lighter">Introduction</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p><b>Inkblot</b> is one of the four currently available <b>Eradicators</b> in Shifted in Monochrome, representing Inkblot (the universe). They've had quite the history with <b>Gray</b>, but is merely a myth to most other denizens of their realm. <br> Though they may not be as powerful as in their own realm, their strength and lingering power leaves them a still-formidable foe towards <b>Experiments</b>.</p>

            <p style="font-size:11px;color:darkgray">Gray's Note: Apologies for the potential confusion over Inkblot (the character) and Inkblot (the universe) the character was originally named as such because they're a physical manifestation of the universe so I figured they'd have the same name.</p>
            
            <h2 style="font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif;color:whitesmoke;font-size:30px;font-weight:lighter">Appearance</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>Inkblot is a tall, anthropomorphic feline-like creature with jet black fur covering their entire body. They have several mouths in various places on their body, though lacks one on their face. They have two glowing white eyes and similarly glowing white paw beans. While difficult to differentiate from the rest of their body, the fur around their paws and footpaws is raised partially.</p>
            <p>During "Last Man Standing", they enter their Monarch form, their appearance altering slightly. The raised fur on their paws and footpaws become a glowing white color, while their paw beans turn jet black. Additionally four disembodied paws float behind them, also glowing white with black beans.</p>

            <h2 style="font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif;color:whitesmoke;font-size:30px;font-weight:lighter">Personality</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>In canon, they don't often show much in terms of personality, instead serving as more of a silent observer and guardian. They're capable of taking care of individuals who directly threaten the balance of their realm, and do so emotionlessly, but this is reserved for immensely dangerous individuals.</p>
            <p>In Shifted in Monochrome, their personality is largely the same, but with a hint of reluctance. Their dialogue when killing an Experiment suggests that they'd rather not, but don't have a choice in the matter.</p>

            <h2 style="font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif;color:whitesmoke;font-size:30px;font-weight:lighter">Gameplay</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>(This is all hypothetical because there isn't exactly any way of knowing how they play since there isn't really any gameplay)</p>
            <p>Inkblot is an Eradicator who rewards positioning and stealth. Their abilities and decent damage allow them to quietly ambush Experiments, however their slower speed can make it difficult for players who prefer to rush into a group to take them out.</p>

                <p>"The world was quiet, just as it was most other days. Nothing notable was happening to cause it concern, yet it was watching everything regardless. Suddenly, it felt a disturbance. Something new. It manifested a physical form near the disturbance to observe it. It looked like an odd ring of pure white flame, similar yet dissimilar to the portals connecting the world and Terra. As the world observed the ring, it begin to pull, rising in intensity until the world couldn't fight against it anymore.</p>
                <p>They awoke in a world unlike their own. A quiet voice gnawed in the back of their mind, urging for them to eradicate all of the experiments. Maybe then they'd be able to return to their own realm."</p>
