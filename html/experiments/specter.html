            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p><b>Specter</b> is one of the 12 currently available <a href=../misc_pages/experiments.html><b>Experiments</b></a> in Shifted in Monochrome, being oen of three to represent Inkblot. A spy for Desolation deep within enemy territory, they blend in with the average crowed while gathering intel. They are very close friends with <a href=gray.html><b>Gray</b></a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>Specter is an anthropomorphic feline-like creature with primarily gray fur, having medium gray fur in their ears. Their paw beans are the same medium gray color. They wear a very light gray cloak with a black Prism logo on the back, as well as medium gray fluff around the collar and wrists. They additionally have medium gray boots with the same fluff around the collar. The boots have a pawprint on the bottom of them. Their most notable feature is the mask they wear. It is a rounded square shape, harboring two black X's with black tears coming from them.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>Specter is quite the sociable and outgoing person, however is a bit of a timebomb in a sense. They sometimes switch between being super energetic and super relaxed on a dime, however their friendly and slightly cocky demeanor remains under every circumstance.</p>
            <p>In Shifted in Monochrome, their personality is amplified slightly. They're quite friendly towards other Experiments, and have a jokester-like attitude towards Eradicators.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>(hypothetical bc no gameplay yet :[)</p>
            <p>Specter is a rusher. The combination of their high movement speed, as well as their abilities, allow them to traverse maps quickly to intercept Eradicators and potentially save their teammates. When compounded with Adrenaline Rush, they have quite the high stun output.</p>

                        <p><b>Climb</b>: Specter is able to cling to and climb up walls upon jumping into them. They will remain attached to the wall for as long as their stamina bar lasts, or until they jump/dash off of it. They have full freedom of movement, being able to move left and right as well as up and down while climbing.</p>
                        <p><b>Cybernetic Physiology</b>: Frostbite wears off slightly faster than for other Experiments, and the Eradicator will be marked by a red highlight if within 24 studs.

If the dash collides with an Experiment, Specter will throw them forwards and slightly up instead. The ability has 3 maximum uses, having a cooldown of 1 second [0.5s AR] before another dash can be used. The throw does not stun the Eradicator.</p>

They both carefully entered the kitchen, finding a strange portal ominously floating in the center of the room.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <ul>
                <li>Specter doesn't have heat regulation vents, leading to them getting thermal regulation implants early on in their work for Desolation.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The implants embedded inside of their torso is why Colors' Manipulated Metal deals minor damage to them.</li>
                    <li>The implants are also why Frostbite lasts for less time.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Their mask isn't just for show. It functions like a wearable computer, providing advantages such as enhanced vision, translation for audio and text, overlays for important location indicators and paths, and a variety of other things.</li>
                <li>Specter is, in fact, not opposed to acts of subterfuge. They were sent by Desolation as a spy, with the goal of infiltrating Moonstone Point and learning everything they can about Prism.</li>
                <li>How Specter managed to obtain all of the records in their shop is unknown, but they keep getting more somehow.</li>
