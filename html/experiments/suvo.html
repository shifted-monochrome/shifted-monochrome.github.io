            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p><b>Suvo</b> is one of the 12 currently available <a href=../misc_pages/experiments.html><b>Experiments</b></a> in Shifted in Monochrome, being oen of three to represent Inkblot. They were created by the Anomalous Research Foundation to serve as a storage unit and sniper, and continue to help their other Experiments in their fight to be free. They're friends with <a href="gray.html"><b>Gray</b></a> and <a href="specter.html"><b>Specter</b></a>, having helped the latter restock their shop during one of their outings to Inkblot.</p>
            
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>Suvo is an anthropomorphic feline-line creature with primarily dark gray fur, having a slightly lighter shade of gray in their ears and pink paw beans. They have a medium gray pullover, with a thick ring of neck fur spilling out over the top of it. They have a yellow mask-like facial structure shaped like a rounded square, similar to Specter's mask. Their mask has a simplistic smiling expression on it, as well as two patches—one being a pastel green color and the other being a pastel blue color. Their mask splits open near the center to reveal their primary storage port.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>Suvo is friendly and helpful, however not exactly the brightest bulb in the shed. They're devoted to getting anything they're tasked with done, however due to how easily distracted they can be, it may take a while for the work to actually be completed.</p>
            <p>In Shifted in Monochrome, their personality is identical. They're still friendly, still help whoever they can, and still try their best to protect people.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <p>(hypothetical bc no gameplay yet :[)</p>
            <p>Suvo has two potential playstyles. Either they can be a support character, sticking with a group of Experiments and helping heal them with Perfectly Portioned at the cost of being more at risk, or they can have a sniper-like playstyle where they perch somewhere and impede the Eradicator's progress with Marksman at the risk of being easily picked off if found alone.</p>

                        <p>Suvo shifts between their normal height and 25% of their initial height. While small, Suvo moves slower and takes more knockback, but can fit through smaller gaps that other Experiments or Eradicators might not be able to get through.</p>

                        <p>Suvo pulls out their sniper rifle. While the rifle is out, you move slightly slower. Pressing M2 will scope in, allowing for more precise shots with a medium speed loss, and pressing M1 will fire the rifle, stunning the Eradicator for 5 seconds. The rifle has 3 shots before it must be reloaded. The ability has a 15 second cooldown if it isn't empty upon finishing, but has a 20 second cooldown if all shots have been expended. <br> Using any ability will put the rifle away, at which point it will reload itself at a rate of 1 shot every 10 seconds.</p>
                        <p>Upon reaching "Last Creature Standing", Whirlwind replaces Marksman. Suvo extends a large tentacle of G84 from their primary storage port, spinning around and hitting an Eradicator up to 2 times. Each hit has medium knockback, and stuns for 3 seconds. The stuns do not stack.</p>
                        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">The above abilities can only be used while Suvo is at their normal height.</p>

                        <p>Suvo rapidly extends a hand made of G84 towards the direction they're looking in. The hand travels for 36 studs, before returning if not impeded. If the G84 comes into contact with an Experiment, Suvo will pull themselves to the experiment and perch onto them. If the hand hits a surface instead, Suvo will be pulled towards that surface. If hitting an Eradicator, it stuns them for 1 second and deals no knockback.</p>
                        <p>Using the ability again while being dragged or missing the ability altogether will result in a 5 second cooldown, while hitting it results in a 20 second cooldown. Suvo will be knocked off of their perch if they change sizes or if the Experiment they're perched on takes damage.</p>
                        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">The above ability can only be used while Suvo is small.</p>

                        <p>Suvo procures an item from their internal storage, which heals 35 health when consumed. Before being consumed, a list will appear on the side of the screen with numbers corresponding to nearby Experiments. The item can be consumed by Suvo if the ability is used again, or can be given to another Experiment by pressing the number next to their name.</p>
                        <p>The ability's cooldown does not start until the item is consumed, meaning a player can't hold one item and immediately have another ready. There is also a 0.5 second delay between using the ability and consuming the item.</p>

            <div class="lore-box">
                <p>"Suvo was created by Atlas during their return to the Foundation with the intent of them serving as a way to store various materials frequently used in the facility. Their variable size and internal padding substance made them a useful asset, however their slightly below-average intelligence and the Foundation's reluctance to use them for security led to furthering of Project SUVO being terminated. Their usefulness to Atlas, both in companionship and storage, resulted in her being allowed to take Suvo home."</p>

                <p>"The quiet hum of air conditioning filled the storage room as Suvo worked. They moved and organized various boxes with ease, placing them on various shelves throughout the room. As they turn to pick up another box to move it, they notice an odd oval-shaped ring floating in the air, made up of some sort of white magic. They padded closer to it out of curiosity. Abruptly, a powerful suction emenated from the portal, pulling Suvo into it and leading to them dropping the box with a quiet thump."</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <hr style="margin-left:0;margin-top:-0.5%;border-color:rgb(76, 76, 76)">
            <ul>
                <li>Suvo's full designation is "Storage Unit VERTEX ORCHID", with VERTEX ORCHID being their identifier, however is referred to as Suvo by most employees because their full designation was deemed to be too much of a mouthful.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Management still refers to them as Storage Unit VERTEX ORCHID.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>They were artificially created by the Anomalous Research Foundation to aid in moving things around and handling breaches, however a combination of their lower intelligence and high value led to the ARF being reluctant towards using them for important tasks.</li>
                <li>In terms of creation date Suvo is the oldest of the trio, being 2 days short of a full year older than Specter.</li>
                <li>Perfectly Portioned was originally concepted to automatically use it on whoever you're perched on, however Gray realized that some people (such as them) may want to perch onto another player to be able to get away quickly while they heal.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It also was originally named Helping Hand, but was renamed to avoid confusion with one of <a href="snow_tempo.html"><b>Tempo</b></a>'s abilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Suvo takes damage from Metal Manipulation due to having quite a few paperclips, binder clips, and staplers stashed inside of them.</li>
